Please briefly describe what your app does.
SPEDucate is a neurodivergent-friendly learning software designed to enhance the educational experience for individuals on the autism spectrum. The app focuses on making learning a more engaging and enjoyable experience by addressing the unique needs of neurodivergent learners by using interactive elements and adaptive features. With SPEDucate, users can explore math while benefiting from personalized learning paths that cater to their specific requirements. 
We implemented an adaptable User Interface, meaning that we can adjust the app interface by tailoring it to the user’s unique preferences. The dynamic graphics include a sleek vs. structured interface, different color and font themes, and different levels of gamified interfaces. In addition, the app features auditory and visual stimuli to positively affect the users. In our development process, we were very aware that abrupt changes to the environment result in distress for the child as they aren’t used to this new situation. To combat this, we purposely made our game extremely minimalistic, which allows u.js to ensure that the user is comfortable throughout their experience and that nothing suddenly bothers them. 
We also structured the app as a game such that it is fun and interactive so that when the user “plays” it, they have their full attention on it with no opportunity to lose focus on the lesson by getting distracted. This makes the app a more fun experience overall and allows them to be more engaged than they would be just solving regular old practice problems.

What inspired you to create this app? 
The inspiration for this app directly stems from a personal connection that one of our members has with special needs – Ilakkiyan’s brother has Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and has encountered numerous challenges when attempting to utilize existing learning platforms as they fail to address his unique personal needs. Observing these struggles sparked a desire in us to create an app that can adapt to those who have needs similar to those of Ilakkiyan’s brother. While building this app, it became painfully clear that the vast majority of educational platforms available on the market are not simply insufficient but also deeply flawed for those like Ilakkiyan’s brother. These platforms, oftentimes, lacked the basic flexibility needed to support their unique ways of learning, leaving them feeling frustrated and upset. We realized that this gap wasn’t just an oversight - it was a glaring failure in how educational tools are designed for neurodivergent individuals. 
The more we explored, the more disheartening it became. The interfaces were either so cluttered and complicated that they became barriers instead of getaways to knowledge, or they were so outdated and static that any hope of maintaining engagement was lost. Watching these struggles unfold strengthened our resolve. It became an emotional battle for us - one that pushed us beyond traditional approaches, making our commitment to design an inclusive and intuitive learning platform even more urgent and personal. We knew that others like Ilakkyan’s brother deserved better. 

What technical difficulties did you face programming your app?
During the development of our app, we faced many technical difficulties. Since none of us were familiar with React Native before the development of this app, we all had to learn a completely new coding language, which was a challenge in itself. 
Another major difficulty was the integration of a cloud database. When we first began, we started with a local database, but we soon realized that moving to a cloud database would prove more beneficial in the long run, as any updates we made on the cloud would be reflected on all devices. One of our members, Nathan, spent an entire month setting up an AWS cloud database that could efficiently make transactions with users. The considerable amount of time spent on this was partially a consequence of the insane complexity that is required to set up a working database, and partially because we were doing this for the first time. However, once set up, the cloud database ended up becoming a life-saving tool for loading up questions and saving user data. 
Finally, implementing an adaptive User Interface also proved to be difficult because of the sheer amount of work required. There were so many UI elements that needed to be tweaked for each UI option, and then further tweaked when differing UI options were combined. Creating a distinct, yet still minimalistic look for every single page while ensuring that it all worked together in a way that made sense took hundreds of lines of code and a large chunk of our time. In the end, though, it proved to be worth it as we are all extremely proud of our final product.

What improvements would you make if you were to create a 2.0 version of your app?
If we were to be able to create a 2.0 version of our app, we would implement several key improvements. We would first have a dataset to analyze user performance by tracking which questions are being answered correctly and incorrectly by the user. Using this data, we could determine which questions are the most useful for any individual user and continually adjust the questions being asked based on the individual's strengths and weaknesses.
In addition to this, we could add a feature to track the user's progress over time, allowing us to give personalized feedback. These improvements would not only help make the learning more effective but also make sure that the app adjusts to the needs of its users. This data could be shown in a parent/teacher dashboard that would allow adults to monitor their child’s performance and make data-driven decisions on what their child needs to grow. Furthermore, with this new data, researchers can also gain helpful data on how autistic kids may learn, and how this learning may change based on the learning environment they are provided with. If done properly, this would be extremely influential on the educational development of future special needs kids. 
Finally, we would make this more into a full-fledged game, with score, collectible items, battles, and so on. A full-on game that both is fun and provides excellent education would be massive in ensuring that user is engaged as they learn and get smarter.
